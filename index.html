<h1>grijq</h1>

<p>A ThemeRoller-ready data grid widget for jQuery UI that consumes normal HTML
tables.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>I wanted a data grid that did not rely on JavaScript arrays and special APIs.
Instead, I wanted a grid that worked from a fully rendered HTML table that
something else could manage, like <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">knockout.js</a>. I
could not find any and, so, tackling the problem like a programmer, spent a
couple of days putting one together.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>On Chrome and Firefox, the parsing and rendering of a table takes no real
difference if your source contains a raw table or a pre-formatted table.</p>

<p>On Internet Explorer, the pre-formatted table takes an apreciably shorter time
to render.</p>

<h2>Works well on</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Chrome 19 for Windows</li>
  <li>Chrome 19 for OS X</li>
  <li>Firefox 13 for Windows</li>
  <li>Firefox 13 for OS X</li>
  <li>Internet Explorer 8 for Windows</li>
  <li>Internet Explorer 9 for Windows</li>
  <li>Opera 12 for Windows</li>
</ul>

<h2>Does not work well on</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Opera 12 for OS X</dt>
  <dd>
    It seems that Opera 12 can't even load the example page. The second 1000-row
    table seems to make it hang forever.
  </dd>
  <dt>Internet Explorer 9 Compatibility View for Windows</dt>
  <dd>
    It seems that IE 9 CV does not honor the CSS that allows it to truncate text
    in the grid cells. So make sure to use the *X-UA-Compatible* `meta` tag to
    notify IE that the page is ok to render as itself.
