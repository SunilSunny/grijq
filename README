## Works well on

* Opera 12 for Windows


## Does not work well on

Opera 12 for OS X
: It seems that Opera 12 can't even load the example page. The second 1000-row
  table seems to make it hang forever.

Internet Explorer 9 Compatibility View for Windows
: It seems that IE 9 CV does not honor the CSS that allows it to truncate text
  in the grid cells. So make sure to use the *X-UA-Compatible* `meta` tag to
  notify IE that the page is ok to render as itself.
