{"name":"grijq","body":"# grijq\r\n\r\nA ThemeRoller-ready data grid widget for jQuery UI that consumes normal HTML\r\ntables.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nI wanted a data grid that did not rely on JavaScript arrays and special APIs.\r\nInstead, I wanted a grid that worked from a fully rendered HTML table that\r\nsomething else could manage, like [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com). I\r\ncould not find any and, so, tackling the problem like a programmer, spent a\r\ncouple of days putting one together.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nOn Chrome and Firefox, the parsing and rendering of a table takes no real\r\ndifference if your source contains a raw table or a pre-formatted table.\r\n\r\nOn Internet Explorer, the pre-formatted table takes an apreciably shorter time\r\nto render.\r\n\r\n## Works well on\r\n\r\n* Chrome 19 for Windows\r\n* Chrome 19 for OS X\r\n* Firefox 13 for Windows\r\n* Firefox 13 for OS X\r\n* Internet Explorer 8 for Windows\r\n* Internet Explorer 9 for Windows\r\n* Opera 12 for Windows\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does not work well on\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt>Opera 12 for OS X</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    It seems that Opera 12 can't even load the example page. The second 1000-row\r\n    table seems to make it hang forever.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>Internet Explorer 9 Compatibility View for Windows</dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    It seems that IE 9 CV does not honor the CSS that allows it to truncate text\r\n    in the grid cells. So make sure to use the *X-UA-Compatible* `meta` tag to\r\n    notify IE that the page is ok to render as itself.\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A missing data grid powered by jQuery.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
